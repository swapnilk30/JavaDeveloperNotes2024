# ✅ **1. Iterate HashMap using EntrySet + Iterator**

Best when you need **both key and value** and want to use an iterator.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class IterateHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("A", 10);
        map.put("B", 20);
        map.put("C", 30);

        Iterator<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> itr = map.entrySet().iterator();
        while (itr.hasNext()) {
            Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry = itr.next();
            System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey() + ", Value: " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

---

# ✅ **2. Iterate HashMap using KeySet + Iterator**

Best when you only need the **key**, but you can get the value using `map.get(key)`.

```java
Iterator<String> itr = map.keySet().iterator();
while (itr.hasNext()) {
    String key = itr.next();
    Integer value = map.get(key);
    System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + value);
}
```

---

# ✅ **3. Iterate HashMap using For-Each Loop (Most Common & Simple)**

```java
for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
    System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey() + ", Value: " + entry.getValue());
}
```

---

# ✅ **4. Iterate HashMap using Lambda Expression (Java 8+)**

```java
map.forEach((key, value) -> {
    System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + value);
});
```

---

# ✅ **5. Iterate HashMap using Stream API (Java 8+)**

### ✔ Using `entrySet().stream()`

```java
map.entrySet()
   .stream()
   .forEach(entry ->
       System.out.println("Key: " + entry.getKey() + ", Value: " + entry.getValue()));
```

### ✔ Using `keySet().stream()`

```java
map.keySet()
   .stream()
   .forEach(key ->
       System.out.println("Key: " + key + ", Value: " + map.get(key)));
```

### ✔ Filter + Stream Example

```java
map.entrySet()
   .stream()
   .filter(e -> e.getValue() > 15)
   .forEach(e -> System.out.println(e));
```

## What is the Collection framework in Java?
- It defines several classes and interface which can be used as objects as single entity.

## What are the main differences between array and collection?

## What is the difference between Collection and Collections?
- Collection is an **interface** which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.
- Collections is an utility **class** present in **java.util** package to define several utility methods (like sorting )for Collection objects.

## There are 9 key interfaces of collection framework.
1. Collection
2. List
3. Set
4. SortedSet
5. NavigableSet
6. Queue
7. Map
8. SortedMap
9. NavigableMap



# List
### Differences between ArrayList and LinkedList 
![string](/images/ArrayList_LinkedList.png)


# Set
- It is child interface of collection.
- It is present in Java.util.Package
- If we want to represent group of individual objects as single entity where duplicates are not allowed and insertion order is not preserved then we should go for set.

## HashSet
- Underlying data structure is hashtable.
- Duplicates are not allowed. If we are trying to insert the duplicates then we won’t get any compile.
- Insertion order is not preserved.
- Heterogenous objects are allowed.
- Null insertion is possible.
- It implements serializable and clonable interface but not random access interface.
- Hashset is best choice if frequent operation is search operation.











# HashMap 
- HashMap is ASynchronized
- HashMap is better for non-threaded applications.
- HashMap allows one null key.
- if Synchronization is not an issue for you then use HashMap.(Single Threaded Programs)


# LinkedHashMap






# HashTable
- HashTable is Synchronized
- HashTable is better for multi-threaded applications.
- HashTable does not allow null key or null values. an attempt to insert a null key or null value will result in NullPointerException.
- if Synchronization is an issue then use HahsTable.(Multi Threaded Programs)
- Considered a legacy class ,originally part of the early versions of java,HashTable remains in the Java API primarily for backward compatibility,esuring that old code that relies on it can still run without modification.

# ConcurrentHashMap
- ConcurrentHashMap is the modern ,efficient alternative to HashTable for Thread-safe operations in java.


# TreeMap


```
Synchronized : One thread at a time can access some part of the code.
```

### equals()
- it checks the equality of two objects.
- it compares the key, whether they are equal or not.
- it is a method of the Object Class. It can be Overridden.
- If you Override the equals() , then it is mandatory to override the hashCode().

### hashcode()
- This is the method of Object Class.
- It returns the hashcode value of the object in integer form.
- The value received from the method is used as bucket number(index).
- The bucket number (index) is the address of the element inside the map.
- HashCode of null Key is 0.

```
obj1.equals(obj2) is true
then 
obj1.hashCode() == obj2.hashCode() must be true.
if not they can be behave very weirdly.
```

### What is the contract between equals() and hashCode().
- if two objects are equal according to the equal() then the hashcode for both the objects must be same.
- it is not necessary that if we have same hashcode for two objects which means those two objects are equal.(This is collision. Better hash function can prevent this.)
- when ever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of java application,the hashcode method must consistently return the same integer.

### Internal Working of HashMap.
1. When we initialize a HashMap , the bucket or Array is initialized.
2. When we call put(key,value) method to insert the content.
3. It will first check whether the key is null or not, if the key is null it calls putForNullKey() which returns index 0, which is always reserved for null key, hashcode for null is zero.
4. if key is not null then it calculates the hashcode of key.
5. After calculation the hashcode of the key , it calls indexfor() by passing the hashcode of the key and length of the table array.
- this method returns the index of the array for that particular key value pair.
- index  = hashCode(key) & (n-1).
6. **After getting the index** , it checks all key present in the linked list at that index using **equals()** if the key is already present in the linked list it **replaces the old value with new value**.
7. if the key is not present in the linked list it appends the specified key value pair at the end of the linked list
8. when the calculated index value is same for two or more keys the collision is resolved by linked list the entry class has an attribute next this attribute always points to the next object in the chain.
