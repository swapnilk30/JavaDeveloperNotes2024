# HashMap 
- HashMap is ASynchronized
- HashMap is better for non-threaded applications.
- HashMap allows one null key.
- if Synchronization is not an issue for you then use HashMap.(Sinngle Threaded Programs)


# LinkedHashMap






# HashTable
- HashTable is Synchronized
- HashTable is better for multi-threaded applications.
- HashTable does not allow null key or null values. an attempt to insert a null key or null value will result in NullPointerException.
- if Synchronization is an issue then use HahsTable.(Multi Threaded Programs)
- Considered a legacy class ,originally part of the early versions of java,HashTable remains in the Java API primarily for backward compatibility,esuring that old code that relies on it can still run without modification.

# ConcurrentHashMap
- ConcurrentHashMap is the modern ,efficient alternative to HashTable for Thread-safe operations in java.


# TreeMap


```
Synchronized : One thread at a time can access some part of the code.
