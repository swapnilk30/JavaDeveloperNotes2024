@ Component
-allows Spring to detect our custom beans automatically.
-Spring has provided a few specialized stereotype annotations: @Controller, @Service and @Repository.
They all provide the same function as @Component.



@ Primary
-There's another annotation called @Primary that we can use to decide which bean to inject when ambiguity is present regarding dependency injection.
-This annotation defines a preference when multiple beans of the same type are present.
-The bean associated with the @Primary annotation will be used unless otherwise indicated.
-This annotation is useful when we want to specify which bean of a certain type should be injected by default.

@ Autowired


@ Qualifier

-By using the @Qualifier annotation, we can eliminate the issue of which bean needs to be injected.[@Qualifier("xyz")]
-We need to take into consideration that the qualifier name to be used is the one declared in the @Component annotation.[@Component("xyz")]
-if both the @Qualifier and @Primary annotations are present, then the @Qualifier annotation will have precedence. Basically, @Primary defines a default, while @Qualifier is very specific.
-The @Qualifier annotation along with @Autowired can be used to remove the confusion by specifiying which exact bean will be wired.



@ Entity
@ Table(name="Table_Name")
@ Id
@ GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
@ Column(name="Column_Name")
@ service
-It is also used at class level. It tells the Spring that class contains the business logic.

@ Repository
-It is a class-level annotation. The repository is a DAOs (Data Access Object) that access the database directly.
The repository does all the operations related to the database.

@ RestController
@ RequestMapping("/emp")
@ RequestBody
@ PostMapping("/save")
@ GetMapping("/allEmp")
@ GetMapping("/{id}")
@ PathVariable
@ RequestParam


@ResponseBody annotation in Spring is used to indicate that the return value of a method should be serialized and sent back as the response body of an HTTP response.
