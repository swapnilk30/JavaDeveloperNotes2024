### How to Create a WAR File For a Spring Boot Project

- Creating a WAR (Web Application Archive) file for a Spring Boot project involves configuring your project to package as a WAR instead of the default JAR (Java ARchive).

- This process requires some changes in your pom.xml file (for Maven projects) and your main application class. Below are the steps to achieve this:


- Ensure the packaging type is set to war in your pom.xml.
```xml
<packaging>war</packaging>
```

- Ensure you have the spring-boot-starter-web dependency.
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
